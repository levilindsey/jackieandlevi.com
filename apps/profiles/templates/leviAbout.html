          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>Levi is a full-stack web-applications engineer.</p>
          <p>Levi is crazy about JavaScript development and is constantly trying to push the envelope with new and exciting ideas for web applications. With each new web app he develops, he tries to learn new technologies and new ways of doing things. He takes pride in his work and strives to design all of his projects to be intuitive and "easy on the eyes"&mdash;both from an outward-facing user perspective and from an internal code-level perspective.</p>
          <p>Levi currently works at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.idean.com/careers" target="_blank">Idean</a>&mdash;where he creates awesome user experiences.</p>
          <p>Levi is originally from from Olympia, WA. He now lives in Sunnyvale, CA with his new wife. She is&nbsp;<a href="/jackie">a beautiful marine mammal ecologist</a> whom he met at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>
          <p>Levi loves code and has a lot of experience as an applications engineer. Check out his&nbsp;<a href="/levi/projects">projects page</a> to learn more. Or fork one of his projects on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/levisl176?tab=repositories" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You could also check out some of his projects on&nbsp;<a href="http://codepen.io/levisl176" target="_blank">CodePen</a>.</p>
          <p>Outside the realm of computer science, Levi has many hobbies/interests. First and foremost, he is a musician. In addition to fiddling with various instruments, Levi is a classically trained singer and has led in many operas and musicals; some of his more notable performances include: Dido and Aeneas (Aeneas), Savitri (Satyavan), and My Fair Lady (Henry Higgins). While at the UW, Levi studied voice with Thomas Harper. You can hear him sing beautiful Germain art songs from his senior recital or twelve a capella songs&mdash;which he arranged, performed, recorded, and mixed&mdash;at&nbsp;<a href="http://reverbnation.com/levilindsey" target="_blank">ReverbNation</a>.</p>
          <p>Some of his other hobbies include: games! (board games, card games, video games, pretty much any game...), brewing beer, scuba diving, blacksmithing, and cooking and baking.</p>
          <p>Levi is also an Eagle Scout, and spent his highschool summers as a camp counsellor/lifeguard at&nbsp;<a href="http://hahobas.org" target="_blank">Camp Hahobas</a>, a boy scout camp in Washington state.</p>
