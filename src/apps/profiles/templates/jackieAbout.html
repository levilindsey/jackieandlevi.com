          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>Jackie is a graduate student studying marine vertebrate ecology at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mlml.calstate.edu/" target="_blank">Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML)</a>. Outside of her thesis and coursework, Jackie is a marine mammal stranding network volunteer for the Monterey area, a volunteer for the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/" target="_blank">Monterey Bay Aquarium</a> sea otter research program, and editor of the student blog,&nbsp;<a href="http://mlmlblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">The Drop In</a>.</p>
          <p>Before moving to California, Jackie studied at the University of Washington in Seattle, where she met her husband. She graduated cum laude with a dual degree in aquatic and fishery science (BS, with honors) and medical anthropology (BA). After graduating, Jackie worked briefly at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seattleaquarium.org/" target="_blank">Seattle Aquarium</a>, giving public presentations and having a great time learning about the ocean with visitors from all over the world.</p>
          <p>Jackie grew up near Phoenix, Arizona and spent much of her childhood studying the performing arts (theatre, ballet, voice) at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.goasa.org/" target="_blank">Arizona School for the Arts</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adamsballet.com/" target="_blank">Adams Ballet Academy</a>. Her theatre credits include A Chorus Line, Once On This Island, and many, many seasons of The Nutcracker. While she sometimes misses the spotlight, she is absolutely crazy about her future career in marine science.</p>
          <p>In her free time, Jackie enjoys scuba diving, reading, yoga, and cookin&apos; up fancy foods with&nbsp;<a href="/levi">her husband</a>.</p>
