In order to upload the image files in bulk, I recommend using lftp. This is a convenient command, that will upload all of the files from a local directory to a directory on the server, and RE-WRITE WHATEVER USED TO BE THERE:

lftp -e "mirror -R <localdir> <remotedir>" -u <username>,<password> <domain>

E.g., this is the command I have run before:

lftp -e "mirror -R weddingphotos weddingphotos" -u ukulelefurycom,mypassword ukulelefury.com
